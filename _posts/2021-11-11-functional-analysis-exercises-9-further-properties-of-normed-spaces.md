This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Further Properties of Normed Spaces section 2.3** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.

### Notes
The requirements for a space to be a normed space are:

- **(N1)** **Nonnegativity**, i.e., $$\|x\| \geq 0, x \in X$$
- **(N2)** **Zero norm** implies **zero vector** and vice versa, i.e., $$\|x\|=0 \Leftrightarrow x=0, x \in X$$
- **(N3)** **Linearity** with respect to **scalar multiplication**, i.e., $$\|\alpha x\|=\vert \alpha \vert \|x\|, x \in X, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$
- **(N4)** **Triangle Inequality**, i.e., $$\|x+y\| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|, x,y \in X$$

#### 2.2.1 Show that the norm $$\|x\|$$ of x is the distance from x to 0.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.1. Show that C c [00 is a vector subspace of [00 (cf. 1.5-3) and so is Co, the space of all sequences of scalars converging to zero.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.2. Show that Co in Prob. 1 is a closed subspace of [00, so that Co is complete by 1.5-2 and 1.4-7.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.3. In [00, let Y be the subset of all sequences with only finitely many nonzero terms. Show that Y is a subspace of [00 but not a closed subspace.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.4. (Continuity of vector space operations) Show that in a normed space X, vector addition and multiplication by scalars are continuous operations with respect to the norm; that is, the mappings defined by(x, y) ~ x+y and (a, x) ~ ax are continuous.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.5. Show that x" ~ x and Yn ~ Y implies Xn + Yn ~ X + y. Show that an ~ a and Xn ~ x implies anx" ~ ax.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.6. Show that the closure Y of a subspace Y of a normed space X is again a vector subspace. 
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.7. (Absolute convergence) Show that convergence of IIYIII + IIY211 + IIY311 + ... may not imply convergence of YI + Y2 + Y3 + .... Hint. Consider Y in Prob. 3 and (Yn), where Yn = ('Y/jn», 'Y/~n) = l/n2, 'Y/jn) = 0 for all j¥ n.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.8. If in a normed space X, absolute convergence of any series always implies convergence of that series, show that X is complete.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.9. Show that in a Banach space, an absolutely convergent series is convergent.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.10. (Schauder basis) Show that if a normed space has a Schauder basis, it is separable.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.11. Show that (en), where en = (c'>nj), is a Schauder basis for IP, where 1 ~p<+oo.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.12. (Seminonn) A seminorm on a vector space X is a mapping p: X~R satisfying (N1), (N3), (N4) in Sec. 2.2. (Some authors call this a pseudonorm.) Show that
    p(O}= 0,  
    Ip(y}- p(x}1 ~p(y - x}.  
    **(Hence if p(x) = 0 implies x = 0, then p is a norm.)**
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.13. Show that in Prob. 12, the ele~ents x E X such that p(x) = 0 form a subspace N of X and a norm on X/N (cf. Prob. 14, Sec. 2.1) is defined by Ilxllo=p(x), where XEX and x EXIN.
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.14. (Quotient space) Let Y be a closed subspace of a normed space(X, 11·11). Show that a norm 11·110 on XIY (cf. Prob. 14, Sec. 2.1) is defined by  
    Ilxllo = inf Ilxll xeX  
    **where x E XI Y, that is, x is any coset of Y.**
**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.15. (Product of nonned spaces) If (Xl> II· III) and (X2 , II· liz) are normed spaces, show that the product vector space X = Xl X X2 (cf. Prob. 13, Sec. 2.1) becomes a normed space if we define
**Proof:**
