In this article, we finally put all our understanding of **Vector Calculus** to use by showing why and how **Lagrange Multipliers** work. We will be focusing on several important ideas, but the most important one is around the **linearisation of spaces at a local level**, which might not be smooth globally. The **Implicit Function Theorem** will provide a strong statement around the conditions necessary to satisfy this.

We will then look at **critical points**, and how constraining them to a manifold naturally leads to the condition that the **normal vector of the curve to be optimised, must also be normal to the tangent space of the manifold**.

We will then restate this in terms of **Lagrange multipliers**.

**Note**: This article pulls a lot of understanding together, so be sure to have understood the material in [Vector Calculus: Graphs, Level Sets, and Linear Manifolds]({%post_url 2021-04-20-vector-calculus-simple-manifolds%}), before delving into this article, or you might get thoroughly confused.
