## Abstract
In this post, I'll talk about how I wrote a small Virtual Machine in Prolog which can both interpret concrete programs, and run symbolic executions, which is useful in data flow analysis of programs.

## Why Prolog?

## Atomic Operations from the ground-up

## Minimal instruction set

## Registers, Flags, and Pointers

## The concrete interpreter

## Aside: Logging

## Symbolic Execution and World Splits

## Prolog as a Modelling Language

## Unification is so powerful
