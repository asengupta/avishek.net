The relevant paper is [Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05131). We will also use [this explanation](https://deeprender.ai/blog/plenoxels-radiance-fields-without-neural-networks) to understand some parts of this paper a little better.

Before we get into the implementations of the paper proper, we will need a game plan. This game plan will include some theoretical background that we will have to go through to implement parts of this paper. The theoretical background will include:

- Camera Model
- Spherical Harmonics
- Volumetric Rendering Model
- Regularisation
-
