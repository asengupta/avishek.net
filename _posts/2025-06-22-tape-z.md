## Abstract
We introduce [Tape/Z](https://github.com/avishek-sen-gupta/tape-z), an evolving toolkit for analysing mainframe HLASM (High Level Assembler) code. The library provides capabilities for working with mainframe assembler code, including parsing, control flow graph building, dependency tracing, and flowchart visualization capabilities.
