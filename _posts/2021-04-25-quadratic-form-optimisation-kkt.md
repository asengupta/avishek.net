This article continues the original discussion on **Quadratic Optimisation**, where we considered **Principal Components Analysis** as a motivation. Here, we frame the Quadratic Optimisation problem in a regular form, and consider cases where constraints are activated versus cases where they are not. Furthermore, we will see how integrating both cases lead to the **Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions**.
