In this article, we take a detour to understand the mathematical intuition behind **Constrained Optimisation**, and more specifically the method of **Lagrangian multipliers**. We have been discussing **Linear Algebra**, specifically matrices, for quite a bit now. **Optimisation theory**, and **Quadratic Optimisation** as well, relies heavily on **Vector Calculus** for many of its results and proofs.

Most of the rules for single variable calculus translate over to vectors calculus, but now we are dealing with **vector-valued functions** and **partial differentials**.

This article will introduce the building blocks that we will need to reach our destination of understanding Lagrangians, with slightly more rigour than a couple of contour plots. **Please note that this is in no way an exhaustive introduction to Vector Calculus, only the concepts necessary to progress towards the stated goal are introduced.** If you're interested in studying the topic furhtre, there is a wealth of material to be found.

We will motivate most of the theory by illustrating the two-dimensional case in pictures, but understand that in actuality, we will often deal with **higher-dimensional vector spaces**.

Before we delve into the material proper, let's look at the big picture approach that you will go through as part of this.

- Graphs and Level Sets
- Jacobians
- Tangent Spaces and Directional Derivatives
- Implicit Function Theorem
- Parameterisation in an underdetermined system of Linear Equations
- Constrained Critical Points
- Lagrangian Reformulation without Paramterisation
