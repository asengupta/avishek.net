We have looked at how **Lagrangian Multipliers** and how they help build constraints as part of the function that we wish to optimise. Their relevance in **Support Vector Machines** is how the constraints about the classifier margin (i.e., the supporting hyperplanes) is incorporated in the search for the **optimal hyperplane**. In this post, we will derive these conditions.
