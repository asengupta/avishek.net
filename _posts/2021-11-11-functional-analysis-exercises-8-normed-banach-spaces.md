This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Normed Space, Banach Space section 2.2** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.

### Notes
The requirements for a space to be a normed space are:

- **(N1)** Nonnegativity, i.e., $$\|x\| \geq 0, x \in X$$
- **(N2)** Zero norm implies zero vector, i.e., $$\|x\|=0 \Rightarrow x=0 x \in X$$
- **(N3)** Linearity with respect to scalar multiplication, i.e., $$\|\alpha x\|=\vert \alpha \vert \|x\|, x \in X, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$
- **(N4)** Triangle Inequality, i.e., $$\|x+y\| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|, x,y \in X$$

#### 2.2.1 Show that the norm Ilxll of x is the distance from x to O.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.2 Verify that the usual length of a vector in the plane or in three dimensional space has the properties (Nt) to (N4) of a norm. 
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.3 Prove (2).
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.4 Show that we may replace (N2) by Ilxll=O x=O without altering the concept of a norm. Show that nonnegativity of a norm also follows from (N3) and (N4).
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.5 Show that (3) defines a norm.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.6 Let X be the vector space of all ordered pairs x = (g1> g2), y = (111) 112), ... of real numbers. Show that norms on X are defined by
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.7 Verify that (4) satisfies (N1) to (N4).
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.8 There are several norms of practical importance on the vector space of ordered n-tuples of numbers (cf. 2.2-2), notably those defined by  
   Ilxlll  IgII + Ig21 + ... + Ignl
   Ilxllp  (lgIIP + Ig21P + ... + IgnIP)I/p (l<p<+oo)
   
   **In each case, verify that (N1) to (N4) are satisfied.**
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.9 Verify that (5) defines a norm.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.10 (Unit sphere) The sphere S(O; 1) ={x E X Illxll = 1} in a normed space X is called the unit sphere. Show that for the norms in Prob. 6 and for the norm defined by the unit spheres look as shown in Fig. 16.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.11 (Convex set, segment) A subset A of a vector space X is said to be convex if x, YEA implies M={ZEXlz=ax+(1-a)y, O~a~1}cA. M is called a closed segment with boundary points x and y; any other Z E M is called an interior point of M. Show that the closed unit ball B(O; 1) ={x E X Illxll~ 1} in a normed space X is convex.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.2.12 Using Prob. 11, show that does not define a norm on the vector space of all ordered pairs x = (gl> g2), ... of real nwnbers. Sketch the curve cp(x) = 1 and compare it with Fig. 18.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.13 Show that the discrete metric on a vector space X¢. {O} cannot be obtained from a norm. (Cf. 1.1-8.)
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.14 If d is a metric on a vector space X¢.{O} which is obtained from a norm, and d is defined by d(x, x) = 0, d(x, y)=d(x, y)+l (x¢. y), show that d cannot be obtained from a norm.
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.2.15 (Bounded set) Show that a subset M in a normed space X is bounded if and only if there is a positive nwnber c such that Ilxll ~ c for every x EM. (For the definition, see Prob. 6 in Sec. 1.2.)
**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$
