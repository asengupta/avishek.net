## Abstract
We introduce [Tape/Z](https://github.com/avishek-sen-gupta/tape-z), an evolving toolkit for analysing mainframe HLASM (High Level Assembler) code. The library provides capabilities for working with mainframe assembler code, including parsing, control flow graph building, dependency tracing, and flowchart visualization capabilities.

## Writing the HLASM grammar

See [Building an HLASM grammar from scratch](2025-06-22-building-hlasm-grammar-from-scratch.md) for more details.

## HLASM and SQL: Multi-pass parsing
