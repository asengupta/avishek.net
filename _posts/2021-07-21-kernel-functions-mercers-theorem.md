This article takes a second perspective to **Kernel Functions** using **Mercer's Theorem**. We discussed this theorem in [Functional Analysis: Norms, Operators, and Some Theorems]({% post_url 2021-07-19-functional-analysis-results-for-operators %}). We will see that Mercer's Theorem applies somewhat more directly to the characterisation of Kernel Functions, and there is no need for an elaborate construction, like we do for **Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces**.
