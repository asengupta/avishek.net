It may seem strange that I'm jumping from implementing a simple neural network into **Transformers**. I will return to building up the foundations of neural networks soon enough: for the moment, let's look at **Transformers**.

There are several excellent guides to understanding the original Transformers architecture; I will use [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) by Jay Alammar to guide this implementation.
