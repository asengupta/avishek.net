This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Compactness and Finite Dimension section 2.5** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.


#### 2.5.1. Show that $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ and $$\mathbb{C}^n$$ are not compact.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.2. Show that a discrete metric space $$X$$ (cf. 1.1-8) consisting of infinitely many points is not compact.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.3. Give examples of compact and noncompact curves in the plane $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.4.  Show that for an infinite subset $$M$$ in Ihe space $$s$$ (cf. 2.2-8) to be compact, it is necessary that there arc numhers $$\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \cdots$$ such that for all $$x=(\xi_k(x)) \in M$$ we have $$\vert \xi_k(x) \vert \leq \gamma_k$$. (It can he shown that the condition is also sufficient for the compactness of $$M$$.)

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.5.  (Local compactness) A metric space $$X$$ is said to be locally compact if every point of $$X$$ has a compact neighborhood. Show that $$\mathbb{R}$$ and $$\mathbb{C}$$ and, more generally, $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ and $$\mathbb{C}^n$$ are locally compact.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.6. Show that a compact metric space $$X$$ is locally compact.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.7. If $$\dim Y < \infty$$ in Riesz's lemma 2.5-4, show that one can even choose $$\theta = 1$$.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.8. In Prob. 7, Sec. 2.4, show directly (without using 2.4-5) that there is an $$a > 0$$ such that $$a {\|x\|}_2 \leq \|x\|$$. (Use 2.5-7.)

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.9. If $$X$$ is a compact metric space and $$M \subset X$$ is closed, show that $$M$$ is compact.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.5.10. Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ be metric spaces, $$X$$ compact, and $$T: X \rightarrow Y$$ bijective and continuous. Show that $$T$$ is a homeomorphism (cf. Prob. 5, Sec. 1.6).

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$
