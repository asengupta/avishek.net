I am Avishek Sen Gupta. I work with ThoughtWorks, Inc., currently based in Bangalore, India. I am a Technical Principal with 17+ years of experience architecting large scale commercial systems, with experience in .NET, Java, Ruby, R, Javascript, and iOS stacks.

My current technical interests include machine learning, statistics, pure mathematics, and distributed systems. Iâ€™ve built mobile articulated arm-equipped robots and worked in machine vision in the past.

I also draw and paint.
