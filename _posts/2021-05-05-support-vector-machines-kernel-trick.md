We will focus on the advantages of pulling up the separating hyperplane to higher dimensions for **Support Vector Machines**, discuss the computational disadvantages of doing this practice, and look at at some of the theory, namely the **Kernel Trick**, which allows us to perform the necessary higher-dimensional computations, without projecting every point in our data set into higher dimensions, explicitly.
