We discussed this theorem at the end of the article on [Lagrange Multipliers]({% post_url 2021-04-24-vector-calculus-lagrange-multipliers%}), with some hand-waving too justify the linear behaviour on manifolds in arbitrary $$\mathbb{R}^N$$.

This article delves a little deeper to develop some more intuition on the Implicit Function Theorem, but starts with its more specialised relative, the Inverse Function Theorem. This is because it is easier to start with reasoning about the Inverse Function Theorem.

## Existence of Function Inverses
### Monotonicity implies Invertibility
### Monotonicity in Higher Dimensions
### Invertibility is proved if $$n$$ equations in $$n$$ unknowns has a solution
## Inverse Function Theorem

## Implicit Function Theorem
### Function Reduction for Free Variables
### Invertibility can be proved for $$n$$ equations in $$m+n$$ unknowns if $$m$$ linearly independent basis vectors exist
