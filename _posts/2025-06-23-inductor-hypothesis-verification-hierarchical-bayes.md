## Abstract
We look at how Hierarchical Bayes Models can be used with simple Beta-Bernoulli prior/posterior updates to recursively decompose a hypothesis into sub-hypotheses to form an inference tree. The beliefs of these sub-hypothese are updated based on the strength of the evidence gathered. These beliefs are propagated upwards through the inference to indicate the aggregate confidence of the original root hypothesis.

## Decomposing hypotheses into inference trees

## Gathering evidence: MCP tools

## Aggregating beliefs: the Beta-Bernoulli conjugate

## Motivating example
