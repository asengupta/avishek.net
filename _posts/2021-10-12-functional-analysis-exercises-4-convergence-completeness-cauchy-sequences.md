This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Convergence, Cauchy Sequences, and Completeness section 1.4** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.

#### 1.4.1. (Subsequence) If a sequence $$(x)$$ in a metric space $$X$$ is convergent and has limit $$x$$, show that every subsequence $$(x_{n_k})$$ of $$(x_n)$$ is convergent and has the same limit $$x$$.

---
#### 1.4.2. If $$(x_n)$$ is Cauchy and has a convergent subsequence, say, $$x_n \rightarrow x$$, show that $$(x_n)$$ is convergent with the limit $$x$$.

---
#### 1.4.3. Show that $$x_n \rightarrow x$$ if and only if for every neighborhood $$V$$ of $$x$$ there is an integer $$n_0$$ such that $$x_n \in V$$ for all $$n > n_0$$.

---
#### 1.4.4. (Boundedness) Show that a Cauchy sequence is bounded.

---
#### 1.4.5. Is boundedness of a sequence in a metric space sufficient for the sequence to be Cauchy? Convergent?

---
#### 1.4.6. If $$(x_n)$$ and $$(y_n)$$ are Cauchy sequences in a metric space $$(X, d)$$, show that $$(a_n)$$, where $$a_n = d(x_n, y_n)$$, converges. Give illustrative examples.

---
#### 1.4.7. Give an indirect proof of Lemma 1.4-2(b).

---
#### 1.4.8. If $$d_1$$ and $$d_2$$ are metrics on the same set $$X$$ and there are positive numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ such that for all $$x, y \in X$$, $$a.d1(x,y) \leq d2(x,y) \leq b.d1(x,y)$$, show that the Cauchy sequences in $$(X, d1)$$ and $$(X, d2)$$ are the same.

---
#### 1.4.9. Using Prob. 8, show that the metric spaces in Probs. 13 to 15, Sec. 1.2, have the same Cauchy sequences.

---
#### 1.4.10. Using the completeness of $$\mathbb{R}$$, prove completeness of $$\mathbb{C}$$.
