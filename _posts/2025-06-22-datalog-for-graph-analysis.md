## Abstract
This post is about experiments in building graph analysis techniques for Control Flow Graphs, and other graphs used in program analysis, in Datalog. One of the examples we will see is how to write a basic block construction algorithm in about 14 lines of Datalog code. We will be specifically using Souffle as the Datalog implementation.

## Datalog as a subset of Prolog

## Souffle: A scalable, typed implementation of Datalog

## Datalog as a better SQL
