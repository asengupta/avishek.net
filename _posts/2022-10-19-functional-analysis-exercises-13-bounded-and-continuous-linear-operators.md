This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Bounded and Continuous Linear Operators section 2.7** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.


#### 2.7.1. Prove that 1) $$\Vert T_1 T_2 \Vert \leq \Vert T_1 \Vert \Vert T_2 \Vert$$ and 2) $$\Vert T^n \Vert \leq {\Vert T \Vert}^n$$.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$
