This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Linear Operators section 2.6** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.


#### 2.6.1. Show that the operators in 2.6-2, 2.6-3 and 2.6-4 are linear.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.2. Show that the operators Tt. ... , T4 from R2 into R2 defined by
(gh g2) ~ (gh 0)
(gh gJ~ (0, g2)
(glo g2)~ (g2, gl)
respectively, are linear, and interpret these operators geometrically.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.3. What. are the domain, range and null space of Th T2 , T3 in Prob. 2?

**Answer:**

---

#### 2.6.4.  What is the null space of T4 in Prob. 2? Of Tl and T2 in 2.6-7? Of T in 2.6-4?

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.5. Let T: X --7 Y be a linear operator. Show that the image of a subspace V of X is a vector space, and so is the inverse image of a subspace W of Y.

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.6. If the product (the composite) of two linear operators exists, show that it is linear.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.7. (Commutativity) Let X be any vector space and S: X --7 X and T: X --7 X any operators. S and T are said to commute if ST = TS, that is, (ST)x = (TS)x for all x E X. Do Tl and T, in Prob. 2 commute?

**Proof:**

$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.8. Write the operators in Prob. 2 using 2 x 2 matrices.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.9. In 2.6-8, write y = Ax in terms of components, show that T is linear and give examples.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.10. Formulate the condition in 2.6-1O(a) in terms of the null space of T.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.11. Let X be the vector space of all complex 2 x 2 matrices and define T: X ~ X by Tx = bx, where b E X is fixed and bx denotes the usual product of matrices. Show that T is linear. Under what condition does T- 1 exist?

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.12. Does the inverse of T in 2.6-4 exist?

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.13. Let T: 2ll( T) ~ Y be a linear operator whose inverse exists. If {Xl' ... , xn } is a linearly independent set in ~(T), show that the set {TXb' .. , Txn } is linearly independent.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.14. Let T: X ~ Y be a linear operator and dim X = dim Y = n < 00. Show that m(T) = Y if and only if 11 exists.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.6.15. Consider the vector space X of all real-valued functions which are defined on R and have derivatives of all orders everywhere on R. Define T: X ~ X by y(t) = Tx(t) = x'(t). Show that m(T) is all of X but 11 does not exist. Compare with Prob. 14 and comment.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$
