<h2>Welcome to IRIS !</h2>
<h3>What is IRIS ?</h3>
<p> IRIS is the vision system being developed for COMRADE.
However, it is also being designed keeping in mind future
expansions and applications on other robot platforms and/or
desktop applications.
As of now, it is still evolving continuously in terms of
code and performance. You can keep track of the latest
developments through this site or by visiting our
<a href="http://livejournal.com/community/project_comrade">
project journal</a>.</p>
<p>IRIS is organised (as of now) functionally into five distinct components:
<ul>
<li><a href="iris_foundation.html"><b>IRIS Foundation</b></a>:
This contains all the data structures and frequently-used
algorithms required by the other two components,
<a href="iris_xt.html">IRIS-XT</a> and <a href="iris_3d.html">
IRIS-3D</a>.</li>
<li><a href="iris_xt.html"><b>IRIS-XT</b></a>:
This component is resposible for the basic image processing
functions as well as all the 2D machine vision tasks like 
line detection and shape matching.</li>
<li><a href="iris_3d.html"><b>IRIS-3D</b></a>:
This component is responsible for performing 3D vision tasks
like 3D reconstruction and stereoscopic vision.</li>
<li><a href="iris_runtime.html"><b>IRIS Runtime</b></a>:
This component (still under active construction), is responsible for
providing a runtime environment within which all objects belonging
to any IRIS class will be created and destroyed. It will also
include an interface to a scripting language like Python, Pike or Cint.</li>
<li><a href="osiris.html"><b>Osiris</b></a>: This is not strictly a part
of IRIS, but it is intended to provide methods for localisation, either
purely vision-based, or based on fused data from sonar and vision.
It should also be capable of map-building in unknown environments, and is
still under construction.</li>
 
</ul>
</p>

<h3>On which platforms can IRIS be used ?</h3>
<p>IRIS is being developed under Windows (98, Me, XP whatever)
using <a href="http://www.bloodshed.net">Dev-C++ 4.9.5</a>.
However, it is targeted for the Linux platform; thus the code has
been kept as platform-independent as possible by sticking to
Standard C++. Both implementations have been merged into a
single distribution, though they will diverge in the near future
(possibly due to linking issues with scripting languages and GUI
issues).
You can find a discussion on this and other issues in the
<a href="iris_discuss.html">Discussions</a> section.
</p>
<p>Currently, IRIS is being tested using gcc 3.3 under Red Hat
Linux 9.</p>

<hr width=100%>

<h3>How can I reuse IRIS ?</h3>
<p>In any way you see fit. IRIS is basically designed for machine
vision applications, but that does not restrict its domain of use.
You can add several algorithms which perform fancy effects, add a
few functions for reading different image formats, and design your
custom image processing engine.</p>
<p>In fact, you can go even further and dismember parts of
<a href="iris_3d.html">IRIS-3D</a> to get a (very) basic 3D graphics
engine (In fact, many functions <a href="iris_3d.html">IRIS-3D</a>
uses have been ripped off from an engine for robotic arm
visualisation I wrote in Turbo C++ a few years ago!).</p>

<hr width=100%>

<h3>Which parts of IRIS are complete enough for me to use ?</h3>
<p>A rather hard question to answer, since IRIS is evolving
continuously. In a sense, a lot of IRIS is complete but a lot still
remains to be done, like some optimisations and inclusion of
better algorithms in existing modules, besides the coding of the
new modules themselves.
<p>However, that does not mean you cannot start using IRIS
immediately for your purposes. Some of my reference material
is listed in the
<a href="iris_references.html">References</a> section. You can also
find out the status of each IRIS component by going to the
appropriate section, or see what IRIS can already do (Check out
the <a href="iris_datasets.html">Datasets</a> section).</p>
