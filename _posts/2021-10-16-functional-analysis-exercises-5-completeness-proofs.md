This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Completeness Proofs section 1.5** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.

#### 1.5.1 Let $$a,b \in \mathbb{R}$$ and $$a<b$$. Show that the open interval $$(a,b)$$ is an incomplete subspace of $$\mathbb{R}$$, whereas the clOsed interval $$[a, b]$$ is complete.
**Proof:**


#### 1.5.2 Let $$X$$ be the space of all ordered n-tuples $$x = (\zeta_1, \cdots, \zeta_n)$$ of real numbers and $$d(x,y)=\text{max }_j \vert \zeta_j-\eta_j\vert$$ where $$y=(\eta_j)$$. Show that $$(X,d)$$ is complete.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.3 Let $$M \subset l^\infty$$ be the subspace consisting of all sequences $$x = (\zeta_j)$$ with at most finitely many nonzero terms. Find a Cauchy sequence in $$M$$ which does not converge in $$M$$, so that $$M$$ is not complete.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.4 Show that $$M$$ in Prob. 3 is not complete by applying Theorem 1.4-7.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.5 Show that the set $$X$$ of all integers with metric $$d$$ defined by $$d(m,n) = \vert m-n\vert$$ is a complete metric space.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.6 Show that the set of all real numbers constitutes an incomplete metric space if we choose $$d(x,y) = \vert \text{arc tan } x - \text{arc tan } y \vert$$.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.7 Let $$X$$ be the set of all positive integers and $$d(m,n)=\vert m^{-1}-n^{-1}\vert$$. Show that $$(X,d)$$ is not complete.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.8 (Space $$C[a, b]$$) Show that the subspace $$Y \subset C[a, b]$$ consisting of all $$x \in C[a, b]$$ such that $$x(a) = x(b)$$ is complete.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.9 In 1.5-5 we referred to the following theorem of calculus. If a sequence $$(xm)$$ of continuous functions on $$[a,b]$$ converges on $$[a,b]$$ and the convergence is uniform on $$[a,b]$$, then the limit function $$x$$ is continuous on $$[a,b]$$. Prove this theorem.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.10  (Discrete metric) Show that a discrete metric space (cf. 1.1-8) is complete.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.11  (Space s) Show that in the space $$s$$ (cf. 1.2-1) we have $$x_n \rightarrow x$$ if and only if $$\zeta^{(n)}_j \rightarrow \zeta_j$$ for all $$j = 1, 2, \cdots$$ , where $$x_n=(\zeta^{(n)}_j)$$ and $$x=(\zeta_j)$$.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.12  Using Prob. 11, show that the sequence space $$s$$ in 1.2-1 is complete.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.13  Show that in 1.5-9, another Cauchy sequence is $$(x_n)$$, where $$x_n(t)=n \text{ if } 0 \leq t \leq n^{-2}$$ and $$x_n(t)=t^{-\frac{1}{2}} \text{ if } n^{-2} \leq t \leq 1$$.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.14  Show that the Cauchy sequence in Prob. 13 does not converge.
**Proof:**



#### 1.5.15  Let $$X$$ be the metric space of all real sequences $$x=(\zeta_j)$$ each of which has only finitely many nonzero terms, and $$d(x,y)=\displaystyle\sum \vert \zeta_j - \eta_j \vert$$, where $$y = (\eta_j)$$. Note that this is a finite sum but the number of terms depends on $$x$$ and $$y$$. Show that $$(x_n)$$ with $$x_n = (\zeta^{(n)}_j)$$,

  $$\zeta^{(n)}_j=j^{-2}$$ for $$j=1,\cdots,n$$ and $$\zeta^{(n)}_j=0$$ for $$j>n$$

  **is Cauchy but does not converge.**

**Proof:**
