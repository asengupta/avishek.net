This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Vector Space section 2.1** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.

#### 2.1. Show that if a subspace $$Y$$ of a metric space consists of finitely manypoints, then $$Y$$ is complete.
**Proof:**

By definition, a limit point $$L$$ of the set $$Y$$ has at least one point $$x \neq L$$ within every neightbourhood $$\epsilon$$. Since $$Y$$ has a finite number of points, then it has no limit points, and thus (vacuously) contains all its limit points.

Thus, $$Y$$ is a complete metric subspace.

#### 2.1.14 (Quotient space, codimension) Let Y be a subspace of a vector space X.

#### 2.1.15 these cosets constitute the elements of a vector space. This space is called the quotient space (or sometimes factor space) of X by Y (or modulo Y) and is denoted by X/Yo Its dimension is called the codimension of Y and is denoted by codim Y, that is, codim Y=dim(X/Y).
