## Introduction

The source code for all of this work is based on [Cobol-REKT](https://github.com/avishek-sen-gupta/cobol-rekt).

## Parser

The parser is the easier part, if only because I reused what was already available. The [COBOL Language Support](https://github.com/eclipse-che4z/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol) extension contains an ANTLR grammar which works. Note that it has been en
