This article continues from where [Every Software Engineer is an Economist]({% post_url 2023-01-22-every-engineer-is-an-economist %}) left off, and delves slightly deeper into some of the topics already introduced there, as well as several new ones. Specifically, we cover the following:

- [Articulating Value: Pair Programming](#articulating-value-pair-programming)
- [Articulating Value: Information Security](#articulating-value-information-security)
- Value Articulation Example

## Articulating Value: Pair Programming

Pair programming effectiveness seems to be a mixed bag, based on a survey of multiple studies in the paper [The effectiveness of pair programming: A meta-analysis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222408325_The_effectiveness_of_pair_programming_A_meta-analysis).

The key takeaway is this:

>  If you do not know the seniority or skill levels of your programmers, but do have a feeling for task complexity, then employ pair programming either when task complexity is low and time is of the essence, or when task complexity is high and correctness is important.
