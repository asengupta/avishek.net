This post lists solutions to the exercises in the **Finite Dimensional Normed Spaces and Subspaces section 2.4** of *Erwin Kreyszig's* **Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications**. This is a work in progress, and proofs may be refined over time.

### Notes
The requirements for a space to be a normed space are:

- **(N1)** **Nonnegativity**, i.e., $$\|x\| \geq 0, x \in X$$
- **(N2)** **Zero norm** implies **zero vector** and vice versa, i.e., $$\|x\|=0 \Leftrightarrow x=0, x \in X$$
- **(N3)** **Linearity** with respect to **scalar multiplication**, i.e., $$\|\alpha x\|=\vert \alpha \vert \|x\|, x \in X, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$
- **(N4)** **Triangle Inequality**, i.e., $$\|x+y\| \leq \|x\| + \|y\|, x,y \in X$$

#### 2.2.1. Show that $$c \subset l^\infty$$ is a vector subspace of $$l^\infty$$ (cf. 1.5-3) and so is $$c_0$$, the space of all sequences of scalars converging to zero.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.3.1. Give examples of subspaces of $$l^\infty$$ and $$l^2$$ which are not closed.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.2. What is the largest possible $$c$$ in (1) if $$X = \mathbb{R}^2$$ and $$x_1 = (1,0), x_2 = (0,1)$$? If $$X = \mathbb{R}^3$$ and $$x_1 = (1,0,0), x_2 = (0,1,0), x_3 = (0,0,1)$$?

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

#### 2.3.3. Show that in Def. 2.4-4 the axioms of an equivalence relation hold (d. Al.4 in Appendix 1).

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.4. Show that equivalent norms on a vector space X induce the same topology for X.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.5. If II· II and II· lin are equivalent norms on X, show that the Cauchy sequences in (X, II ·11) and (X, 11·110) are the same.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.6. Theorem 2.4-5 implies that II . liz and 11·1100 in Prob. 8, Sec. 2.2, are equivalent. Give a direct proof of this fact.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.7. Let II· liz be as in Prob. 8, Sec. 2.2, and let 11·11 be any norm on that vector space, call it X. Show directly (without using 2.4-5) that there is a b > ° such that Ilxll ~ b Ilxllz for all x.

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.8. Show that the norms II ·111 and II· liz in Prob. 8, Sec. 2.2, satisfy 1~ Ilxllt ~ 114 ~ Ilxlb·

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.9. If two norms II . II and II . 110 on a vector space X are equivalent, show that (i) Ilxn - xll---- 0 implies (ii) Ilxn - xllo ---- ° (and vice versa, of course).

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$

---

#### 2.3.10. Show that all complex m x n matrices A = (ajk) with fixed m and n constitute an mn-dimensional vector space Z. Show that all norms on Z are equivalent. What would be the analogues of II· III> II . 112 and II . 1100 in Prob. 8, Sec. 2.2, for the present space Z?

**Proof:**


$$\blacksquare$$
