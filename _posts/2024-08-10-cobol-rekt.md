## Introduction

The source code for all of this work is based on [Cobol-REKT](https://github.com/avishek-sen-gupta/cobol-rekt).

## Parser

The parser is the easier part, if only because I reused what was already available. The [COBOL Language Support](https://github.com/eclipse-che4z/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol) extension contains an ANTLR grammar which works. Note that it has been en

## Control Flow Graph (early version)

A very naive version of a flowgraph can be built which is still tied to COBOL constructs. The nodes in this flowgraph represent native COBOL constructs. These nodes were originally designed to represent COBOL code as visual flowcharts, like below:

![Example flowchart](/assets/images/example-flowchart.png)

These nodes did not necessarily represent control flow very accurately, because of the following:

- There were always straight-line causal connections between every COBOL sentence. This included statements which unambiguously jumped to other sections/paragraphs of the program. This is because se

## Intermediate representation

### Translation into Syntax Tree
A more language-agnostic way of representing control flows (as well as syntax), is to decompose all COBOL-specific constructs into some simple intermediate representation which is more or less well-supported in most structured programming languages. Examples of such constructs would be:

- ```IF...THEN...ELSE```
- ```SET```
- ```LOOP``` (can represent normal loops, ```WHILE```, and ```DO...WHILE``` constructs)

The ```LOOP``` semantic provides a nice way to encapsulate the semantics of different kinds of loops:

- ```WHILE```-like constructs only have a termination condition and a ```ConditionTestTime``` attribute set to ```BEFORE```.
- ```DO...WHILE```-like constructs only have a termination condition and a ```ConditionTestTime``` attribute set to ```AFTER```.
- **Loop-like constructs** only have an initial value, a maximum value, a loop update expression, and a ```ConditionTestTime``` attribute set to ```BEFORE```.

A couple of examples of this translation process are shown below.

### Translating ```EVALUATE```
```
EVALUATE TRUE ALSO TRUE
              WHEN SCALED + RESULT < 10 ALSO INVOICE-AMOUNT = 10
                MOVE "CASE 1" TO SOMETHING
              WHEN SCALED + RESULT > 50 ALSO
                INVOICE-AMOUNT = ( SOMETEXT + RESULT ) / SCALED
                MOVE "CASE 2" TO SOMETHING
              WHEN OTHER
                MOVE "CASE OTHER" TO SOMETHING
            END-EVALUATE
```

This becomes:

```
if(and(eq(primitive(true), lt(add(ref('SCALED'), ref('RESULT')), primitive(10.0))), eq(primitive(true), eq(ref('INVOICE-AMOUNT'), primitive(10.0))))) 
 then 
{
	CODE_BLOCK: CODE_BLOCK: set(ref('SOMETHING'), value(primitive("CASE 1"))) 
}
 
else 
{
	if(and(eq(primitive(true), gt(add(ref('SCALED'), ref('RESULT')), primitive(50.0))), eq(primitive(true), eq(ref('INVOICE-AMOUNT'), divide(add(ref('SOMETEXT'), ref('RESULT')), ref('SCALED')))))) 
	 then 
	{
		 CODE_BLOCK: CODE_BLOCK: set(ref('SOMETHING'), value(primitive("CASE 2"))) 
	}
	 
	else 
	{
		 CODE_BLOCK: CODE_BLOCK: set(ref('SOMETHING'), value(primitive("CASE OTHER"))) 
	}
}
```

### Translating ```PERFORM INLINE```

```
PERFORM TEST BEFORE VARYING SOME-PART-1 FROM 1 BY 1
UNTIL SOME-PART-1 > 10
AFTER SOME-PART-2 FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL SOME-PART-2 > 10
    DISPLAY "GOING " SOME-PART-1 " AND " SOME-PART-2
END-PERFORM.
```

This becomes:

```
loop[loopVariable=ref('SOME-PART-1'), initialValue=primitive(1.0), maxValue=NULL, terminateCondition=gt(ref('SOME-PART-1'), primitive(10.0)), loopUpdate=primitive(1.0), conditionTestTime=BEFORE] 
{
	loop[loopVariable=ref('SOME-PART-2'), initialValue=primitive(1.0), maxValue=NULL, terminateCondition=gt(ref('SOME-PART-2'), primitive(10.0)), loopUpdate=primitive(1.0), conditionTestTime=BEFORE] 
	{
		CODE_BLOCK: print(value(primitive("GOING ")), value(ref('SOME-PART-1')), value(primitive(" AND ")), value(ref('SOME-PART-2')))
	}
}
```

The translation process results in the intermediate syntax tree expressed in this intermediate form. Everything is converted into **intermediate instructions**. Note that ```GO TO``` statements carry over as ```JUMP``` statements; thus, the resulting intermediate program may still not be well-structured enough to be expressible in a modern progreamming language.

## Translation into Control Flowgraph

The flowgraph is created from the intermediate syntax tree with a few salient points to note:

- Every instruction is represented by 3 separate sentinel instructions: ```ENTER```, ```EXIT```, and ```BODY```. These are useful when dealing with branching statements  or when delineating sections of code which are COBOL sections or paragraphs.
- Control flow edges are added only as needed, and not indiscriminately as in the earlier version of the flowgraph.
- Subroutine calls result in one outgoing edge from the call instruction ```BODY``` to the ```ENTER``` instruction of the start routine, and one incoming edge from the ```EXIT``` instruction of the end routine (which can be the start routine itself) to the ```EXIT``` instruction of the call instruction. The diagram below shows this scheme (the dotted arrow doesn't actually exist).

    TJ_ENTRY["[ENTER] jump(subroutine-1)"]
    TJ_BODY["[BODY] jump(subroutine-1)"]
    TJ_EXIT["[EXIT] jump(subroutine-1)"]
    T2["..."]
    TS1_ENTRY["[ENTER] subroutine-1"]
    TS1_BODY["[BODY] subroutine-1"]
    T3["..."]
    TS1_EXIT["[EXIT] subroutine-1"]
    TJ_ENTRY --> TJ_BODY
    TJ_BODY -.-> TJ_EXIT
    TJ_EXIT --> T2
    TJ_BODY --> TS1_ENTRY
    TS1_ENTRY --> TS1_BODY
    TS1_BODY --> T3
    T3 --> TS1_EXIT
    TS1_EXIT --> TJ_EXIT
```

## Control Flow Analysis
In compiler theory, control flow analysis is usually done for the purposes of enabling various code optimisations and transformations. One way this is done is by identifying control structures in code which are not immediately apparent. For example, loops made out of ```IF```s and ```GOTO```s can be identified and such apparently 'unstructured' code can be transformed into structured programming constructs.

Such transformations are made easier when flowgraphs have a property called **reducibility**. There are several equivalent characterisations of flowgraphs. They are all explained in some depth [here](https://rgrig.blogspot.com/2009/10/dtfloatleftclearleft-summary-of-some.html), but I'll attempt to sim

### The concept of a 'natural loop'

    T1 --> T2
    T2 --> T3
    T3 --> T4
    T4 --> T5
    T5 --> T1
    T5 --> T6
```

Intuitively, we can see
