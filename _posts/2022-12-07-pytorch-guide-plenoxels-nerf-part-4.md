We continue looking at [Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05131). We have built our volumetric renderer; it is now time to start calculating loss from training images. We start off with trying out some test images, the source of which will be our renderer itself, as a kind of control set.

### Incorporating Training Images

### Calculating Loss

### Optimising using RMSProp

### Reconstruction Results
