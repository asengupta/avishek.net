**Every software engineer is also an economist; an architect, even more so.** There is a wealth of literature around articulating value of software development, and in fact, several agile development principles embody some of these, but I see two issues in my day-to-day interactions with software engineers and architects.

- Folks are reluctant to quantify things they build, beyond the standard practices they have been brought up on (like estimation exercises, test coverage). Some of this can be attributed to their prior bad experiences of being micromanaged via largely meaningless metrics.
- Folks struggle to articulate value beyond a certain point to stakeholders who demand a certain measure of rigour and/or quantifiability. The DORA metrics are good starter indicators, but I contend that they are not enough.
- Thinking about value and deciding tradeoffs based on economic factors is not something that is done enough, if at all, at the level of engineering teams. For example, questions like "Should I do this refactoring?" and "Why should we repay this tech debt?", or "How are we better at this versus our competitor?" are usually framed in terms of statements which stop before traversing the full utility tree of value.

Thinking in these terms, and projecting these decisions in these terms to micromanagers, heads/directors of engineering -- but most importantly, to execs -- is key to engineers getting the necessary clout in higher-strategic decisions. It is also an instrumental value engineers should acquire to break several firms' perceptions that "engineers are here to do what we say".

This is easier said than done, because of several factors:

- The data to apply these frameworks is not always easily available.
- Engineers are usually emotionally invested in decisions that they think are their "pet" ideas.
- It can be hard to inculcate this mindset en masse among engineers if they do not have a clear perception of the value of adopting this mindset. Engineers don't want theory, they want tools they can apply quickly and easily. Hence the burden is on us to propose advances to the state of the art in a way that is actionable.

Important Concepts that every software developer should know:

- Decision-Making Processes
- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Cash Flows and Cash Instances
  - How do we quantify future cash flows?
- Net Present Value
- Real Options
  - Disadvantages of the NPV approach
  - Opportunity Cost
  - Example
- Agile in SEE
  - Delayability
