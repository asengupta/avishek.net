We will discuss the Column-into-Rows computation technique for matrix outer products. This will lead us to one of the important factorisations (the LU Decomposition) that are used computationally when solving systems of equations, or computing matrix inverses.

## Conclusion
This rule of swapping the order of the outer product will also apply to when we are calculating inverses.
